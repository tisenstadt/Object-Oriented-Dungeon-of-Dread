I hope you enjoy this reworked version of my Dungeon! Converting this to an object-oriented style was a big accomplishment.
My next goal is to create a more intelligent input system for the game that will recognize additional words.
I'm also aiming to have a basic combat system implemented into the game.

ENJOY!
